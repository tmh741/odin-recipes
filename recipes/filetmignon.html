        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a really good recipe for almost any meat that requires almost no ingredients and a few minutes.
            It works really well with filet mignon and almost anything else.
            There are almost no additives though, so it works best with good meat!

        <h3>Recommended Sides</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Any potato side</li>
            <li>Any vegetable, but especially asparagus, brocolli, or beans</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut of Meat</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>That's literally it</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure meat is prepared (thawed if it's frozen, and maybe rinsed and dried)</li>
            <li>Put pan to medium heat. Once hot, cover with salt</li>
            <li>Put steak on salted pan. Let sit for ~3-5 minutes</li>
            <li>Try flipping steak. If it's ready on one side, you should be able to move it, so if it sticks let it sit</li>
            <li>Repeat last step for other side. You're done!</li>
        </ol>
