        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p> This is a chicken nugget recipe I was taught when I was very young! 
            It's very simple and very easy to do, especially if you're busy.
            It work with tenders or breasts as well, it's quite versatile!
            If you're short on time, it's great for a movie night or for tired nights!
            They're also great left over, especially when cooked with fried rice. :3
        </p>

        <p>
            This recipe will involve three simple steps: cutting the chicken, prepping it for cooking,
            and cooking. It doesn't get simpler than this!
            If you want to be more ambitious, this recipe is very similar to making <em>>Wiener Schnitzel</em>, 
            <em>Chicken Milanesa</em>, or <em>katsu</em>!
